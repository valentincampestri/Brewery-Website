<h1> Brewery Website </h1>

Project carried out as a team for the Argentine University of Enterprise, using HTML, CSS, JS (framework: Bootstrap 5). Task instructions for the assignment:

<h2>Objectives</h2>

Design, layout, and implement a website using Bootstrap 5, HTML, CSS, and custom JavaScript. The design should be functional for the content outlined in the given guidelines. A coherent process must be demonstrated, starting from the proposal and conception of the design and graphic identity to be communicated, preliminary sketches adhering to usability best practices, and implementation using front-end languages. The resulting design should be responsive to different screen resolutions and devices, emphasizing the correct application of the mobile-first layout technique.

<h2>Content</h2>

Homepage: Must contain five sections or information blocks (in addition to site navigation to other pages):

One section should include a banner, image slider, or similar, occupying the entire (or almost the entire) visual width of the page.
Call to Action: an imperative block inviting us to take a specific action such as Reserve, Order Online, Participate, View Products, Buy, etc.
One section should include "information pills," with small images or icons accompanied by text beside or below them (or an image with hidden text revealed on hover). These may lead to other site pages or open modal boxes with additional information.
Product Gallery or Images: all with text in the form of captions or headlines with additional information.
Testimonials from customers, suppliers, sponsors. Ideally, include a carousel.
Internal Pages: In addition to the explicitly mentioned pages, two additional HTML documents should be added with information such as "About Us," "Business/Entrepreneurship History," "Services," "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)," "Frequently Asked Questions," or others to be defined with the instructor. All sections must have text and multimedia content (images, videos, and/or audio). The information should be presented with hierarchical headlines from h1 to h3 (semantics must be justified), including text, lists, paragraphs, images, etc.

Products: Create a catalog of products, a menu-like card, or a merchandise store. It can be integrated and developed using jQuery with plugins to enhance the user experience. Work on this integration with the professor in the mentioned subject.

Contact: In addition to a Bootstrap JavaScript validated form, the page should include information about branches, stores, facilities, and/or offices. It should engage with the user (a form alone is not sufficient).

<h2>Content for All Documents</h2>

Navigation (nav) or header enclosing nav.logo and links to all pages.
Footer (in all HTML documents).

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>

The site presentation should adapt to the device width (no horizontal scrolling in any size and/or resolution), and there should be no initial content scaling by the browser.
If CSS3 transitions, transformations, and/or animations are included, it's at the student's discretion whether these features will appear on all screen resolutions and/or devices where the site is rendered.
Images on the site must be optimized in weight and size for each screen resolution or device.
The HTML title tag must contain student data: name, surname, class, shift, and year of enrollment.
The page must present a logo or logotype whose development is preferably original (the page title cannot be presented as text).
In the largest viewport size (desktop), a single column of content cannot be used (all contents stacked).
(*) The page footer must include the following elements: personal and enrollment data (names, surnames, subjects, class, and year of enrollment) and the social media bar (buttons as images of at least 3 social networks that can simply link to the social network's website and not to a specific user or company, for example, open Instagram and not a user of that social network).
